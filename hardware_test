## Hardware test W/ Fuse Block:
- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico W on a breadboard
- 1x H-Bridge module (the one with B+/B-/M+/M- terminals)
- 1x SCORBOT arm connected to your DB50 breakout board
- 1x 12V Power Supply
- 1x Digital Multimeter
- 7x Jumper Wires
- 1x Micro-USB cable and a computer with Thonny
- 6x 12-AWG wire
- 1x 6-way fuse block
- 1x 5A fuse
- 10x Terminal connectors

## Main Power Circuit (12V): 
# Provides the high-current power to drive the motor
- 12V PSU (+) Terminal → Fuse Block Main Positive Input.
- 12V PSU(-) Terminal → Fuse Block Main Negative Input
- Fuse Block Fused Output → H-Bridge B+ (Battery Positive) screw terminal.
- Fuse Block Negative Bus Bar → H-bridge B- (Battery Negative) screw terminal
## Logic Power Circuit (5V): 
# Provides the brain of your H-bridge module.
- Pico W VBUS Pin → H-bridge VCC pin.
## Control Signals Circuit: 
# The command wires from the pico’s brain to the H-bridge.
- Jumper Wires from Pico W GP14 → H-Bridge RPWM 
- Jumper Wires from Pico W GP13 → H-Bridge LPWM
- Jumper Wires from Pico W GP16 → H-Bridge R_EN (Right Enable)
- Jumper Wires from Prico W GP17 → H-Bridge L_EN(Left Enable)
## Motor Output Circuit: 
# The final path where switched power travels to the motor
- H-Bridge Motor Positive → DB50 Breakout Terminal #17
- H-Bridge Motor Negative → DB50 Breakout Terminal #50
## Shared Ground
# Provides the high-current power to drive the motor
- A jumper wire from PICO W GND Pin to the Fuse Blocks Negative Bus Bar.
- A jumper wire from PICO W GND Pin to H-Bridge GND Pin.
