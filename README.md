## 📊 Master Pinout & Data Architecture

To manage the complexity of the legacy 50-pin interface, I normalized the hardware connections into a relational dataset. This abstracts physical wiring into logical addresses for the software.

### Master DB50 Pinout Map

## 🛠️ Engineering Methodology

### 1. Direct GPIO Hardware Interface (Prototype Phase)

For the initial multi-axis cyclic tests (`4cycle.py`), the system utilized a **Direct-Drive Topology**. The Raspberry Pi Pico W served as the centralized motion controller, interfacing directly with four independent BTS7960B H-Bridge drivers. This configuration bypassed the I2C bus to minimize latency and isolate variables during the initial motion sequencing validation.

  * **Signal Mapping:** GPIO pins were assigned in contiguous blocks to optimize routing. For example, the Base Axis utilized the lower-mid section of the Pico header, while the Elbow Axis utilized the upper section to physically separate signal paths.
  * **Abstraction:** The control logic utilized a custom `Motor` class acting as a **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**. This allowed the software to define high-level behaviors (e.g., `shoulder.forward()`) which were dynamically translated into specific voltage states.

### 2. Distributed Fleet Architecture (Production Phase)

To scale beyond the pin limitations of a single microcontroller, I architected a **Distributed Control System**:

  * **The Brain (Raspberry Pi 4):** Acts as the central "Mission Control." It runs the main Python logic, calculates timing, and manages the fleet state. It communicates via USB Serial (UART) to multiple subordinates.
  * **The Spinal Cords (Pico W):** Act as real-time hardware controllers. They run a "Listener" loop that waits for serial commands (`MOVE_BASE`, `STOP`) and handles the high-speed GPIO switching.
  * **Power Topology:** A Dual-Rail Power Architecture was implemented to isolate high-current inductive loads (12V Motors) from sensitive logic components (5V/3.3V). A common ground reference was established at the fuse block to ensure signal integrity across the distributed system.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap: Closed-Loop Autonomy

The next phase introduces "Visual Autonomy" using the **Google Data Analytics Process**:

1.  **Collect:** Capture image datasets of target objects via Pi Camera.
2.  **Process:** Annotate images using LabelImg to define bounding boxes.
3.  **Analyze:** Train a TensorFlow Lite model for object detection.
4.  **Act:** Convert pixel coordinates into motor step commands for precise pick-and-place operations.
